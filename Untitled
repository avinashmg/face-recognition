Objectives:
1. Battery (Temperature, Cutoff value(preset), ) - Overcharging,
2. Motor (Temperature, Current supply, Shaft bending, RPM, )
3. Motor controller (ECU) - Collect data as a backup
4. Cooling Systems (Fan RPMS, Airflow temperature)
5. Driver behaviour in relation to range,

Failures:
1. Motor (Shaft bending, Coil burnout)
2. Controller ()
3. Cooling System - Shorting,
4. Battery - Partial Failure,
